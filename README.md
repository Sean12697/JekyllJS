# Jekyll.JS (Blog-aware Static Site Generator in NodeJS)

This is a satiric repository which has been made to mimic Jekyll (even using assets from Jekyll's [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme) but instead of being written in Ruby, it has been written in NodeJS. 

Currently you can only alter the `_config.js` file and add files to the `_posts` folder to be generated, but there may be more features to come (or feel free to submit PR's).
